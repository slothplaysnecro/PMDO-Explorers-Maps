This is a repository containing maps from Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky that have been imported and setup for use in projects for [Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Origins](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump). Feel free to use these in your own projects.

This is a work in progress, and contributions are very welcome.

Initial assets were sourced from [Explorers of Sky Origins](https://github.com/Minemaker0430/ExplorersOfSkyOrigins).

Backgrounds in need of manual rebuilds:

- D04P31A (Waterfall Cave End)
- D06P11A (Craggy Coast Entrance)
